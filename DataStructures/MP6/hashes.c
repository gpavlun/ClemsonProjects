/* hashes.c 
 * Lab6: Hash Tables 
 * ECE 2230, Fall 2025
 * 
 * For MP6: you do not need to modify this file unless you want to invent
 *          a new hash function.  
 *
 * Use these functions:
 *
 *    hashes_table_pos
 *    hashes_probe_dec
 *
 * If you do invent your own hash funtion, make sure to notify the
 * instructor and describe it in your test plan.
 *
 * Most notes and functions are from Eternally Confuzzled web page by Julienne
 * Walker (JSW).  Now hosted on:

   https://github.com/ppelleti/jsw-libs/blob/master/Tutorials/jsw_tut_hashing.md

 * ECE 2230 changes:
 *     Changed all functions to use hashkey_t (a character string) as key.  
 *     Replaced length with strlen since we know strings end with null.
 *     Changed jen_hash to ignore initval
 *
 *     jsw_hash is broken.  Hacked to create static table of random numbers.
 *     tab_hash is based on Tabulation Hash, and is hacked.  It may ruin
 *        the properties of this hash?
 *
 * All but elf_hash work great with random keys.  Perhaps elf would
 * be better with longer strings?
 *
 * With -h double or chain they are all good.  With double hashing primary 
 *    clustering is avoided.  With chain clustering is not important.
 *
 * These all work well for random keys, but -i seq is poor due to clustering
 *      djb_hash
 *      djb_hash_xor
 *      sax_hash
 *      fnv_hash
 *
 * These work well for -i seq. Perhaps due to good avalanche properties?
 *      oat_hash
 *      jen_hash
 *      jsw_hash
 *      tab_hash
 *
 * This works poorly for -i seq and -i rand because keys are too short?
 *      elf_hash
 *      weird observation -i rand -m 65537 is poor but 65500 and 65600 are
 *      fine???  Appears that a table size that is near a power of two breaks 
 *      this hash.  Perhaps because low order bits are not randomized well.

 * #### Bernstein
 
Dan Bernstein created this algorithm and posted it in a newsgroup. It is
known by many as the Chris Torek hash because Chris went a long way
toward popularizing it. Since then it has been used successfully by
many, but despite that the algorithm itself is not very sound when it
comes to avalanche and permutation of the internal state. It has proven
very good for small character keys, where it can outperform algorithms
that result in a more random distribution:

Bernstein's hash should be used with caution. It performs very well in
practice, for no apparently known reasons (much like how the constant 33
does better than more logical constants for no apparent reason), but in
theory it is not up to snuff. Always test this function with sample data
for every application to ensure that it does not encounter a degenerate
case and cause excessive collisions.

    }

    return h;
}

/* #### Modified Bernstein

A minor update to Bernstein's hash replaces addition with XOR for the
combining step. This change does not appear to be well known or often
used, the original algorithm is still recommended by nearly everyone,
but the new algorithm typically results in a better distribution:

    }

    return h;

/* #### Shift-Add-XOR hash

The shift-add-XOR hash was designed as a string hashing function, but
because it is so effective, it works for any data as well with similar
efficiency. The algorithm is surprisingly similar to the rotating hash
except a different choice of constants for the rotation is used, and
addition is a preferred operation for mixing. All in all, this is a
surprisingly powerful and flexible hash. Like many effective hashes, it
will fail tests for avalanche, but that does not seem to affect its
performance in practice.

/* #### FNV hash

The FNV hash, short for Fowler/Noll/Vo in honor of the creators, is a
very powerful algorithm that, not surprisingly, follows the same lines
as Bernstein's modified hash with carefully chosen constants. This
algorithm has been used in many applications with wonderful results, and
for its simplicity, the FNV hash should be one of the first hashes tried
in an application. It is also recommended that the [FNV website]
(http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/) be visited for
useful descriptions of how to modify the algorithm for various uses.

/* #### One-at-a-Time hash

Bob Jenkins is a well known authority on designing hash functions for
table lookup. In fact, one of his hashes is considered state of the art
for lookup, which we will see shortly. A considerably simpler algorithm
of his design is the One-at-a-Time hash:

This algorithm quickly reaches avalanche and performs very well. This
function is another that should be one of the first to be tested in any
application, if not the very first. This algorithm is my personal
preference as a first test hash, and it has seen effective use in
several high level scripting languages as the hash function for their
associative array data type.

/* #### JSW hash

This is a hash of my (JSW) own devising that combines a rotating hash with a
table of randomly generated numbers. The algorithm walks through each
byte of the input, and uses it as an index into a table of random
integers generated by a good random number generator. The internal state
is rotated to mix it up a bit, then XORed with the random number from
the table. The result is a uniform distribution if the random numbers
are uniform. The size of the table should match the values in a byte.
For example, if a byte is eight bits then the table would hold 256
random numbers:

In general, this algorithm is among the better ones that I have tested
in terms of both distribution and performance. I may be slightly biased,
but I feel that this function should be on the list of the first to test
in a new application using hash lookup.

/* #### ELF hash

The ELF hash function has been around for a while, and it is believed to
be one of the better algorithms out there. In my experience, this is
true, though ELF hash does not perform sufficiently better than most of
the other algorithms presented in this tutorial to justify its slightly
more complicated implementation. It should be on your list of first
functions to test in a new lookup implementation:

/* #### Jenkins hash

The dreaded Jenkins hash has been thoroughly tested and passes all kinds
of tests for avalanche and permutations. As such it is considered to be
one of the best and most thoroughly analyzed algorithms on the market
presently. Unfortunately, it is also ridiculously complicated compared
to the other hashes examined in this tutorial:
